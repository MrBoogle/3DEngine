# 3DEngine
This is a software renderer pipelined entirely in the CPU that can render meshes in the Windows console. This does not use any graphics APIs, and is built from the ground up using linear algebra (projection and rotation matrices, etc. See this [computer graphics paper](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~king/coursedir/m308a01/Projects/m308a01-pdf/yip.pdf) for more info). Lots of thanks to Javidx9 for his amazing tutorial.
